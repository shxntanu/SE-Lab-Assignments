# SPPU Microprocessor Lab Assignments

## Question 1

Write an x86/64 ALP to accept five 64 bit hexadecimal numbers from the user and store them in an array and display the accepted numbers.

## Question 2

Write an x86/64 ALP to accept a string and to display its length.

## Question 3

Write an x86/64 ALP to find the largest of given byte/word/Dword 64 bit numbers.

## Question 4

Write a switch case driven X86/64 ALP to perform 64-bit hexadecimal arithmetic operations (+,-,*, /) using suitable macros. Define procedure for each operation.

## Question 5

Write an X86/64 ALP to count number of positive and negative numbers from the array.

## Question 6

Write X86/64 ALP to convert 4-digit Hex number into its equivalent BCD number and 5- digit BCD number into its equivalent HEX number. Make your program user friendly to accept the choice from user for: (a) HEX to BCD b) BCD to HEX (c) EXIT. Display proper strings to prompt the user while accepting the input and displaying the result. (Wherever necessary, use 64-bit registers)

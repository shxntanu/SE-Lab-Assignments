# SPPU DSL Assignments

Codes of the Assignments in the DSL Lab Manual of SPPU Second Year Computer Engineering Syllabus.

**Problem Statements:** 

<h3><a href="https://github.com/shxntanu/SE-Lab-Assignments/blob/DSL/Q1_List.py">Question 1:</a></h3>

In second year computer engineering class, group A student’s play cricket, group B students
play badminton and group C students play football. Write a Python program using functions
to compute following: - 

1. List of students who play both cricket and badminton 
2. List of students who play either cricket or badminton but not both 
3. Number of students who play neither cricket nor badminton 
4. Number of students who play cricket and football but not badminton. 

(Note- While realizing the group, duplicate entries should be avoided, Do not use SET built-in functions)

<h3><a href="https://github.com/shxntanu/SE-Lab-Assignments/blob/DSL/Q2_StringOps.py">Question 2:</a></h3>

Write a Python program to compute following operations on String:

1. To display word with the longest length 
2. To determines the frequency of occurrence of particular character in the string 
3. To check whether given string is palindrome or not 
4. To display index of first appearance of the substring 
5. To count the occurrences of each word in a given string 

(Do not use string built-in functions)

<h3><a href="https://github.com/shxntanu/SE-Lab-Assignments/blob/DSL/Q3_Matrix.py">Question 3:</a></h3>

Write a python program to compute following computation on matrix:

1. Addition of two matrices 
2. Subtraction of two matrices
3. Multiplication of two matrices 
4. Transpose of a matrix

<h3><a href="https://github.com/shxntanu/SE-Lab-Assignments/blob/DSL/Q4_Searching.py">Question 4:</a></h3>

1. Write a python program to store roll numbers of student in array who attended training
program in random order. Write function for searching whether particular student attended
training program or not, using Linear search and Sentinel search.

2.  Write a python program to store roll numbers of student array who attended training
program in sorted order. Write function for searching whether particular student attended
training program or not, using Binary search and Fibonacci search

<h3><a href="https://github.com/shxntanu/SE-Lab-Assignments/blob/DSL/Q5_Sorting.py">Question 5:</a></h3>

Write a python program to store second year percentage of students in array. Write function
for sorting array of floating-point numbers in ascending order using - 

1. Insertion sort 
2. Shell Sort 

And display top five scores

<h3><a href="https://github.com/shxntanu/SE-Lab-Assignments/blob/DSL/Q6_QuickSort.py">Question 6:</a></h3>

Write a python program to store first year percentage of students in array. Write function for
sorting array of floating point numbers in ascending order using quick sort and display top
five scores.

### Question 7: 

1. The ticket booking system of Cinemax theater has to be implemented using C++ program.
There are 10 rows and 7 seats in each row. Doubly circular linked list has to be maintained
to keep track of free seats at rows. Assume some random booking to start with. Use array to
store pointers (Head pointer) to each row. On demand 
   - The list of available seats is to be displayed 
   - The seats are to be booked 
   - The booking can be cancelled.

2. Write C++ program for storing binary number using doubly linked lists. Write functions - 
   - To compute 1‘s and 2‘s complement 
   - Add two binary numbers

### Question 8: 

Write C++ program for storing appointment schedule for day. Appointments are booked
randomly using linked list. Set start and end time and min and max duration for visit slot.
Write functions for - 
   - Display free slots 
   - Book appointment 
   - Cancel appointment (check validity, time bounds, availability) 
   - Sort list based on time
   - Sort list based on time using pointer manipulation

### Question 9: 

In any language program mostly syntax error occurs due to unbalancing delimiter such as
(),{},[]. Write C++ program using stack to check whether given expression is well
parenthesized or not.

### Question 10:

Implement C++ program for expression conversion as infix to postfix and its evaluation
using stack based on given conditions: 
- Operands and operator, both must be single character. 
- Input Postfix expression must be in a desired format. 
- Only '+', '-', '*' and '/' operators are expected.

### Question 11:

Queues are frequently used in computer programming, and a typical example is the creation
of a job queue by an operating system. If the operating system does not use priorities, then
the jobs are processed in the order they enter the system. Write C++ program for simulating
job queue. Write functions to add job, display job and delete job from queue.

### Question 12:

Write program to implement a priority queue in C++ using an order list/array to store the
items in the queue. Create a class that includes the data items (which should be template)
and the priority (which should be int). The order list/array should contain these objects, with
operator <= overloaded so that the items with highest priority appear at the beginning of the
list/array (which will make it relatively easy to retrieve the highest item.)

### Question 13:

A double-ended queue (deque) is a linear list in which additions and deletions may be made
at either end. Obtain a data representation mapping a deque into a one dimensional array.
Write C++ program to simulate deque with functions to add and delete elements from either
end of the deque.

## All the files are named according to the question numbers!

# SPPU Object Oriented Programming and Computer Graphics Lab Assignments

Codes of the Assignments in the OOPCGL Lab Manual of SPPU Second Year Computer Engineering Syllabus.

**Problem Statements:** 

## OOP

### Question 1:

Implement a class Complex which represents the Complex Number data type. Implement the
following
1. Constructor (including a default constructor which creates the complex number 0+0i).
2. Overload operator+ to add two complex numbers.
3. Overload operator* to multiply two complex numbers.
4. Overload operators << and >> to print and read Complex Numbers.

### Question 2: 

Develop a program in C++ to create a database of student’s information system containing the
following information: Name, Roll number, Class, Division, Date of Birth, Blood group, Contact
address, Telephone number, Driving license no. and other. Construct the database with
suitable member functions. Make use of constructor, default constructor, copy constructor,
destructor, static member functions, friend class, this pointer, inline code and dynamic
memory allocation operators-new and delete as well as exception handling.

### Question 3: 

Imagine a publishing company which does marketing for book and audio cassette versions.
Create a class publication that stores the title (a string) and price (type float) of publications.
From this class derive two classes: book which adds a page count (type int) and tape which
adds a playing time in minutes (type float).
Write a program that instantiates the book and tape class, allows user to enter data and
displays the data members. If an exception is caught, replace all the data member values with
zero values.

### Question 4: 

Write a C++ program that creates an output file, writes information to it, closes the file, open
it again as an input file and read the information from the file.

### Question 5:

Write a function template for selection sort that inputs, sorts and outputs an integer array and
a float array.

### Question 6: 

Write C++ program using STL for sorting and searching user defined records such as personal
records (Name, DOB, Telephone number etc) using vector container.

OR

Write C++ program using STL for sorting and searching user defined records such as Item
records (Item code, name, cost, quantity etc) using vector container

### Question 7

Write a program in C++ to use map associative container. The keys will be the names of states
and the values will be the populations of the states. When the program runs, the user is
prompted to type the name of a state. The program then looks in the map, using the state
name as an index and returns the population of the state.


## CG

### Question 1:

### Question 2:

Write C++ program to draw a concave polygon and fill it with desired color using scan fill
algorithm. Apply the concept of inheritance.

### Question 3:

Write C++ program to implement Cohen Southerland line clipping algorithm.

### Question 4:

1.  Write C++ program to draw 2-D object and perform following basic transformations, Scaling
b) Translation c) Rotation. Apply the concept of operator overloading.

OR

2. Write C++ program to implement translation, rotation and scaling transformations on
equilateral triangle and rhombus. Apply the concept of operator overloading.

### Question 5:

Design and simulate any data structure like stack or queue visualization using graphics.
Simulation should include all operations performed on designed data structure. Implement
the same using OpenGL. 

### Question 5:

Write C++ program to generate snowflake using concept of fractals.

### Question 6:

Design and simulate any data structure like stack or queue visualization using graphics.
Simulation should include all operations performed on designed data structure. Implement
the same using OpenGL. 

### Question 7:

1. Write a C++ program to control a ball using arrow keys. Apply the concept of
polymorphism.

OR

2. Write a C++ program to implement bouncing ball using sine wave form. Apply the concept
of polymorphism.
